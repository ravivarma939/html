      <b>Sung Jinwoo</b> is the main protagonist of the web novel turned webtoon
      Solo Leveling.[1] He is one of the awakened humans who became able to use
      mana, but ranked as the World's Weakest Hunter, being the weakest E-Rank
      Hunter. Following the traumatic experience of survival inside the Double
      Dungeon, Jinwoo became the "Player" of the System, a magical program that
      only he has access to that grants him unique overpowered powers that no
      other hunters on Earth has. Now, Jinwoo soon delved down the path of
      becoming the World's Strongest Hunter after he was Reawakened.

      Upon his Reawakening, becoming a player of the System, Jinwoo went from
      the appearance of an frail teenage boy drastically into a lean young man
      with a well-developed physique, as a result of the System assisting in his
      growth to make him stronger. He now became a rather tall and handsome
      young man able to attract the attention of most woman. Although, at first,
      his wore basic clothing because of his lack of funds since gaining more
      money and access to the System Shop, he gained access to various items and
      clothing that no other Hunter has access two. Most of the clothing that he
      wears ranging from wearing black clothing that fits his current mindset
      and abilities.

    <h5>PLOT</h5>
    <p id="solo">In a world where hunters — human warriors who possess supernatural abilities — must battle deadly monsters to protect mankind from certain annihilation, a notoriously weak hunter named Sung Jinwoo finds himself in a seemingly endless struggle for survival. One day, after narrowly surviving an overwhelmingly powerful double dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious program called the System chooses him as its sole player and in turn, gives him the unique ability to level up in strength. This is something no other hunter is able to do, as a hunter's abilities are set once they awaken. Jinwoo then sets out on a journey as he fights against all kinds of enemies, both man and monster, to discover the secrets of the dungeons and the true source of his powers.</p>
