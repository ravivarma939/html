                        Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having 250 million 
                        copies in circulation worldwide in 47 countries and regions, with 153 million 
                        copies in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies
                        Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto.
                         It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his 
                         peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told
                          in two parts: the first is set in Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second
                           in his teens (volumes 28–72). The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995),
                            which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).
                         A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha,
                        the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries
                         in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze,
                          at the cost of his life, seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki,
                           making him a host of the beast.[i] The Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the
                            leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often scorned by Konoha's villagers for being the host 
                            of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events
                            , Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years

                    <p><h2>ONE PIECE:</h2>
                        One Piece (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written 
                        and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's 
                        shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual 
                        chapters compiled in 108 tankōbon volumes as of March 2024. The story follows the
                         adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, where he explores the Grand Line in search of
                        the mythical treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.
                        The world of One Piece is populated by humans and other races such as dwarves
                         (more akin to faeries in size), giants, merfolk, fish-men, long-limbed tribes, 
                         long-necked people known as the Snakeneck Tribe, and animal people (known as "Minks").
                          The world is governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World Government, 
                          consisting of dozens of member countries. The Navy is the sea military branch of the World Government that
                           protects the known seas from pirates and other criminals. There is also Cipher Pol which is a group of agencies
                            within the World Government that are their secret police. While pirates are major opponents against the Government, 
                            the ones who really challenge their rule are the Revolutionary Army who seeks to overthrow them. The central tension 
                            of the series pits the World Government and their forces against pirates. The series regularly emphasizes moral ambiguity
                             over the label "pirate", which includes cruel villains, but also any individuals that do not submit to the World Government's 
                             authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—rule. The One Piece world also has supernormal characteristics like Devil Fruits,[Jp 1] 
                             which are mysterious fruits that grant whoever eats them transformative powers. Another supernatural power is Haki,[Jp 2] which grants 
                             its users enhanced willpower, observation, and fighting abilities, and it is one of the only effective methods of inflicting bodily harm on certain Devil Fruit users.

                    <p><h2>JUJUTSU KAISEN:</h2>
                        Jujutsu Kaisen is a Japanese manga 
                        series written and illustrated by Gege Akutami. It has been serialized in 
                        Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 2018, with its
                         chapters collected in 26 tankōbon volumes as of April 2024. The story follows high
                          school student Yuji Itadori
                         as he joins a secret organization of Jujutsu Sorcerers to eliminate a powerful Curse 
                         named Ryomen Sukuna, of whom Yuji becomes the host.
                         Yuji Itadori is an unnaturally physically strong high school student living in Sendai.
                          On his deathbed in June 2018, his grandfather instills two powerful messages within Yuji:
                          "always help others" and "die surrounded by people". Yuji's friends at the Occult Club attract
                           Curses to their school when they unseal a rotten finger talisman. Yuji swallows the finger to protect 
                           Jujutsu Sorcerer Megumi Fushiguro, becoming host to a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna. Due to Sukuna's 
                           evil nature, all sorcerers are required to exorcise him (and, by extension, Yuji) immediately. However upon seeing Yuji retaining 
                           control over his body, Megumi's teacher Satoru Gojo brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School with a proposal to his superiors: postpone Yuji's death sentence and train under Gojo until he consumes all 20 of Sukuna's fingers so the Curse can be eliminated. At the same time, a group of Cursed Spirits plot
                          a multi-layered attack on the world of Jujutsu sorcery, including the Cursed Spirit Mahito and a corrupted sorcerer named Suguru Geto, who was executed by Gojo a year prior.

                        In a world where hunters — human warriors who possess supernatural abilities —
                         must battle deadly monsters to protect mankind from certain annihilation,
                          a notoriously weak hunter named Sung Jinwoo finds himself in a seemingly endless
                           struggle for survival. One day, after narrowly surviving an overwhelmingly powerful 
                           double dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious program called the 
                           System chooses him as its sole player and in turn, gives him the unique ability to level up 
                           in strength. This is something no other hunter is able to do, as a hunter's abilities are set
                            once they awaken. Jinwoo then sets out on a journey as he fights against all kinds of enemies,
                             both man and monster,
                         to discover the secrets of the dungeons and the true source of his powers.
